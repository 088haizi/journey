# content/pages
Place your custom files here (e.g. in sub folders) to serve them with Journey.

Let's say you have a page (html, css) in content/pages/mypage/.

That page will be reachable under yourblog.url/mypage, as long as that url isn't used by a Journey function (e.g. if there is a post by that name).
